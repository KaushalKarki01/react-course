Today I revised git commands and practically implemented how to use commands such as init, check git status, commit the code, add the files to the remote respository, clone the folder from the remote repository. I also learned about git branching and merging, also how to delete the branch from the repository and switch between the branches.

After completing the git revision, I started the Udemy course on React Js. In today's lecture, I watched the roadmap of the course and the projects that I am going to build during the course. After that I learned about the use of react and why frontend frameworks exists nowdays and why we don't use vanilla javascript anymore.

I set up the visual studio code environment installing several extensions such as eslint, preetier, Quokka, for my easiness during the development period. Also I had a quick tour of the react official documentation and explored where to get the details on specific topic. The course had a module for javascript recap so I at first decided to complete it and for today I was able to revise few concepts such as rest and spread operator and when to use it. Template literals, object and array destructuring, ternary operators and arrow function.

-> Used the extension called Quokka to test the javascript code as we write. To set it up just enter ctrl+shift+p and select Quokka.js for current file.

Completed the remaining course on javascript recap which included short circuiting and logical operators: how to use them.
Also learned how optional chaining (?) can be used to check whether the property exists or not and if not how we can pass the fallback value using the ?? (nullish coalescing operator). After that I revised different array methods such as map, filter, sort, reduce, where and how to use them and in what type of circumstances. Later, I worked on how to manipulate the arrays and objects without changing the original one. Had some practice on how to perform insert, delete and update on array and objects. On the end of this section, I learned on how to use the async function to fetch the data from api.
