Today I revised git commands and practically implemented how to use commands such as init, check git status, commit the code, add the files to the remote respository, clone the folder from the remote repository. I also learned about git branching and merging, also how to delete the branch from the repository and switch between the branches.

After completing the git revision, I started the Udemy course on React Js. In today's lecture, I watched the roadmap of the course and the projects that I am going to build during the course. After that I learned about the use of react and why frontend frameworks exists nowdays and why we don't use vanilla javascript anymore.

I set up the visual studio code environment installing several extensions such as eslint, preetier, Quokka, for my easiness during the development period. Also I had a quick tour of the react official documentation and explored where to get the details on specific topic. The course had a module for javascript recap so I at first decided to complete it and for today I was able to revise few concepts such as rest and spread operator and when to use it. Template literals, object and array destructuring, ternary operators and arrow function.

-> Used the extension called Quokka to test the javascript code as we write. To set it up just enter ctrl+shift+p and select Quokka.js for current file.

Completed the remaining course on javascript recap which included short circuiting and logical operators: how to use them.
Also learned how optional chaining (?) can be used to check whether the property exists or not and if not how we can pass the fallback value using the ?? (nullish coalescing operator). After that I revised different array methods such as map, filter, sort, reduce, where and how to use them and in what type of circumstances. Later, I worked on how to manipulate the arrays and objects without changing the original one. Had some practice on how to perform insert, delete and update on array and objects. On the end of this section, I learned on how to use the async function to fetch the data from api.

After completing the javascript revision I walked through the react section where I learn about the jsx, components,and props. In the starting I created a react app through the Create React App for a pizza menu application. While doing this project I learned on how to make components on react and how to assemble multiple components to create a beautiful user interface. During this time, I also learned on how to pass data from the parent component to the child by the help of props. Anything can be passed through the props and in React data flows from top to bottom i.e. from parent to child.While in the middle of this section, there was a challenge part to create a profile card on sandbox and I created it based on my own design.
At the end of the section, I learned on how to map through a list and render the objects to the components.Also I learned how to use the conditional rendering to render the component based on a certain condition. With the help of conditional rendering, we can use multiple returns on a single component.On the final part I got to know how to destructure the props and use it to make our code clean. I got to know that by using react fragments it helps to main the ui of the code. And at the end I learned how to conditionally set the classname and texts.
